# Travel-Map-App
This Travel Map App is made by using React-JS, Node-JS, MongoDB and Express framework.

To build this app I used React-JS with funcitonal components and hooks.
In backend part I used NodeJs, Express FrameWork & MongoDB.

In this app I took one map in that User can pin any location and give reviews. While giving reviews we can add Title of that place along with some description. 
Also we are able to give ratings out of 5 to particular location which comes under reviews section.

Another functionality of this app is we can also see others reviews as well by cliking on that pin. 
MongoDB has been used for storing all users reviews and details.
